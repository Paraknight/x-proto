# Project X #
-------------

## About ##

This is an unamed project that is a multiplayer WebGL game inspired by a bunch of games. One of my forever projects.

## Project Style Guide ##

- Indentation - Tabs
- Brackets - No spaces before or after. No space before commas.
- Braces - Same line, e.g.:
```
void getX() {
	return x;
}
```
- Variables and functions in camelCase, classes in PascalCase.

## Project Git Conventions ##

- The `master` branch has the latest *stable* build.
- The `live` branch has latest *released* build.
- Prefix dev branches with group names. See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273695/git-branch-naming-best-practices) for examples.
